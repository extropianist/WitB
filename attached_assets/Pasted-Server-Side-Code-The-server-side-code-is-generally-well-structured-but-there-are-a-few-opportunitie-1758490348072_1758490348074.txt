Server-Side Code
The server-side code is generally well-structured, but there are a few opportunities for improvement:

Database Query Efficiency: The getRoomsByUser function in server/storage.ts has a potential N+1 query issue. It loops through a user's memberships and performs multiple database queries inside the loop to get room details, box counts, item counts, and member counts. This is inefficient. A better approach would be to use a single, more complex Drizzle ORM query with joins and subqueries to fetch all the necessary data at once.

Error Handling: In server/index.ts, the error-handling middleware includes a line throw err; after sending the response. This is not standard Express.js behavior and can cause the process to crash. It's recommended to remove this line to allow the application to handle errors gracefully without exiting.

Google API Quotas: The requirements document specifies implementing exponential backoff to handle Google Sheets API quotas. The current implementation in server/services/google-sheets.ts does not explicitly include this logic for appendRows or updateRows, which could lead to errors if the app experiences a sudden burst of requests. Implementing this retry logic would make the application more robust.

Caching: The GoogleDriveService in server/services/google-drive.ts caches the app root folder ID in a Map. While this improves performance by avoiding a repeated API call, the cache is not persistent and will be reset every time the server restarts. A more robust solution would be to store this ID in the database once it's created.

Client-Side Code
The client-side code is well-organized using modern React and state management libraries. The primary areas for improvement are completing features that were marked as TODO:

Incomplete Features: The files client/src/components/items/AddItemModal.tsx, client/src/components/items/PhotoGalleryModal.tsx, and client/src/pages/BoxDetail.tsx contain TODO comments related to Google Picker API integration. The current code only shows a placeholder or toast message for photo uploads. This functionality needs to be implemented to fully meet the project's requirements.

Placeholder UI: The QRCodeModal.tsx component displays a generic QR code icon as a placeholder. The actual QR code image generated by the server and stored in Google Drive needs to be fetched and rendered to complete this feature.

User Experience: The TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY in client/src/hooks/use-toast.ts is set to an extremely long value (1,000,000 milliseconds). This effectively prevents toast messages from disappearing automatically. A more user-friendly value, such as 5,000 (5 seconds), should be used for dismissible notifications.

General Recommendations
Feature Completeness: The project outlines a feature to generate down-sized thumbnail copies of photos for performance. The current implementation in server/services/google-drive.ts has a placeholder function createThumbnail that simply returns the original file. This should be replaced with actual image processing logic to improve page load times for pages with many items.

User Interface: The user role badge in client/src/components/layout/AppHeader.tsx currently hardcodes the display role. It should be dynamically updated to reflect the user's actual role in the current room. This would require fetching the user's membership role for the specific room they are viewing and passing it to the component.
